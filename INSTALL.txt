Hello grader!

Run the following in ubuntu:

git clone git@github.coecis.cornell.edu:mmc323/CS-3110-CHESS.git
cd CS-3110-CHESS
make build
make play

Enjoy!

Notes:
Some shells have trouble displaying the unicode characters for chess pieces,
causing the board to be misrendered. If this happens, try running the program
in the vscode terminal.
